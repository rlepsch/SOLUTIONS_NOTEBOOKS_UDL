# SOLUTIONS_NOTEBOOKS_UDL
Jupyter Notebooks from book UNDERSTANDING DEEP LEARNING (Prof Simon Prince) that I could solve.
I started studying this book on october 2023 and solving all notebooks for each chapter I finished. I have not worked at the proposed problems at the book, as my focus has been reviewing the theory, acquiring more 
mathematical understanding on it and using the notebooks to not lose my proficiency in Python.
